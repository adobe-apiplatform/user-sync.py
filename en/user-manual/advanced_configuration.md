User Sync requires additional configuration to synchronize user
data in environments with more complex data structuring.

- When you manage your Adobe ID users out of spreadsheets or your
enterprise directory, you can configure the tool not to ignore
them.
- When your enterprise includes several Adobe organizations, you
can configure the tool to add users in your organization to
groups defined in other organizations.
- When your enterprise user data includes customized attributes
and mappings, you must configure the tool to be able to recognize
those customizations.
- When you want to use username (rather than email) based logins.
- When you want to manage some user accounts manually through the Adobe Admin Console in addition to using User Sync

# Managing Users with Adobe IDs

There is a configuration option `exclude_identity_types` (in 
the `adobe_users` section of the main config file) which
is set by default to ignore Adobe ID users.  If you want User Sync to 
manage some Adobe Id type users, you must turn this option off in the 
config file by removing the `adobeID` entry from under `exclude_identity_types`.

You will probably want to set up a separate sync
job specifically for those users, possibly using CSV inputs
rather than taking inputs from your enterprise directory. If you do this, be sure
to configure this sync job to ignore Enterprise ID and Federated
ID users, or those users are likely to be removed from the
directory!

Removal of Adobe ID users via User Sync may not have the effect you desire:

* If you specify that adobeID users should be
removed from your organization, you will have to re-invite them
(and have them re-accept) if you ever want to add them back in.
* System administrators often use Adobe IDs, so removing Adobe ID
users may inadvertently remove system administrators (including
yourself)

A better practice, when managing Adobe ID users, is simply add
them and manage their group memberships, but never to remove
them.  By managing their group memberships you can disable their
entitlements without the need for a new invitation if you later
want to turn them back on.

Remember that Adobe Id accounts are owned by the end user and 
cannot be deleted.  If you apply a delete action, User Sync will 
automatically substitute the remove action for the delete action.

You can also protect specific Adobe Id users from removal by User Sync 
by using the other exclude configuration items.  See
[Protecting Specific Accounts from User Sync Deletion](#protecting-specific-accounts-from-user-sync-deletion)
for more information.

# Accessing Users in Other Organizations

A large enterprise can include multiple Adobe organizations. For
example, suppose a company, Geometrixx, has multiple departments,
each of which has its own unique organization ID and its own
Admin Console.

If an organization uses either Enterprise or Federated user IDs,
it must claim a domain. In a smaller enterprise, the single
organization would claim the domain **geometrixx.com**. However,
a domain can be claimed by only one organization. If multiple
organizations belong to the same enterprise, some or all of them
will want to include users that belong to the enterprise domain.

In this case, the system administrator for each of these
departments would want to claim this domain for identity use. The
Adobe Admin Console prevents multiple departments from claiming
the same domain.  However, once claimed by a single department,
other departments can request access to another department's
domain. The first department to claim the domain is the *owner*
of that domain. That department is responsible for approving
any requests for access by other departments, who are then able
to access users in the domain without any special configuration
requirements.

No special configuration is required to access users in a domain
that you have been granted access to. However, if you want to add
users to user groups or product configurations that are defined
in other organizations, you must configure User Sync so that it
can access those organizations. The tool must be able to find the
credentials of the organization that defines the groups, and be
able to identify groups as belonging to an external organization.


# Accessing Groups in Other Organizations

To configure for access to groups in other organizations, you
must:

- Include additional umapi connection configuration files.
- Tell User Sync how to access these files.
- Identify the groups that are defined in another organization.

## 1. Include additional configuration files

For each additional organization to which you require access, you
must add a configuration file that provides the access
credentials for that organization. The file has the
same format as the connector-umapi.yml file.  Each additional organization will be referred to by a short nickname (that you define).  You can name the configuration file that has the access credentials for that organization however you like.  

For example, suppose the additional organization is named "department 37".  The config file for it might be named: 

`department37-config.yml`

## 2. Configure User Sync to access the additional files


The `adobe-users` section of the main configuration file must
include entries that reference these files, and
associate each one with the short organization name. For
example:

```yaml
adobe-users:
  connectors:
    umapi:
      - connector-umapi.yml
      - org1: org1-config.yml
      - org2: org2-config.yml
      - d37: department37-config.yml  # d37 is short name for example above
```

If unqualified file names are used, the configuration files must be in the same folder as the main configuration file that references them.

Note that, like your own connection
configuration file, they contain sensitive information that must
be protected.

## 3. Identify groups defined externally

When you specify your group mappings, you can map an enterprise
directory group to an Adobe user group or product configuration defined in another
organization.

To do this, use the organization identifier as a prefix to the
group name. Join them with "::". For example:

```yaml
- directory_group: CCE Trustee Group
  adobe_groups:
    - "org1::Default Adobe Enterprise Support Program configuration"
    - "d37::Special Ops Group"
```

# Custom Attributes and Mappings

It is possible to define custom mappings of directory attribute
or other values to the fields used to define and update users:
first name, last name, email address, user name, country, and group membership.
Normally, standard attributes in the directory are used to
obtain these values.  You can define other attributes to be used and
specify how field values should be computed.

To do this, you must configure User Sync to recognize any non-standard
mappings between your enterprise directory user data and Adobe
user data.  Non-standard mappings include:

- Values for user name, groups, country, or email that are in or
are based on any non-standard attribute in the directory.
- Values for user name, groups, country, or email must be
computed from directory information.
- Additional user groups or products that must be added to or
removed from the list for some or all users.

Your configuration file must specify any custom attributes to be
fetched from the directory. In addition, you must specify any
custom mapping for those attributes, and any computation or
action to be taken to sync the values. The custom action is
specified using a small block of Python code. Examples and
standard blocks are provided.

The configuration for custom attributes and mappings go in a separate
configuration file.  That file is referenced from the main
configuration file in the `directory_users` section:

```yaml
directory_users:
  extension: extension-config.yml  # reference to file with custom mapping information
```

Custom attribute handling is performed for each user, so the
customizations are configured in the per-user subsection of the
extensions section of the main User Sync configuration file.

```yaml
extensions:
  - context: per_user
    extended_attributes:
      - my-attribute-1
      - my-attribute-2
    extended_adobe_groups:
      - my-adobe-group-1
      - my-adobe-group-2
    after_mapping_hook: |
        pass # custom python code goes here
```

## Adding custom attributes

By default, User Sync captures these standard attributes for each
user from the enterprise directory system:

* `givenName` - used for Adobe-side first name in profile
* `sn` - used for Adobe-side last name in profile
* `c` - used for Adobe-side country (two-letter country code)
* `mail` - used for Adobe-side email
* `user` - used for Adobe-side username only if doing Federated ID via username

In addition, User Sync captures any attribute names that appear in
filters in the LDAP connector configuration.

You can add attributes to this set by specifying them in an
`extended_attributes` key in the main configuration file, as shown above. The
value of the `extended_attributes` key is a yaml list of strings, with
each string giving the name of a user attribute to be
captured. For example:

```yaml
extensions:
  - context: per-user
    extended_attributes:
    - bc
    - subco
```

This example directs User Sync to capture the `bc` and `subco`
attributes for every user loaded.

If one or more of the specified attributes is missing from the
directory information for a user, those attributes are
ignored. Code references to such attributes will return the
Python `None` value, which is normal and not an error.

## Adding custom mappings

Custom mapping code is configured using an extensions section in
the main (user sync) config file. Within extensions, a per-user
section will govern custom code that's invoked once per user.

The specified code would be executed once for each user, after
attributes and group memberships have been retrieved from the
directory system, but before actions to Adobe have been
generated.

```yaml
extensions:
  - context: per-user
    extended_attributes:
      - bc
      - subco
    extended_adobe_groups:
      - Acrobat_Sunday_Special
      - Group for Test 011 TCP
    after_mapping_hook: |
      bc = source_attributes['bc']
      subco = source_attributes['subco']
      if bc is not None:
          target_attributes['country'] = bc[0:2]
          target_groups.add(bc)
      if subco is not None:
          target_groups.add(subco)
      else:
          target_groups.add('Undefined subco')
```

In this example, two custom attributes, bc, and subco, are
fetched for each user that is read from the directory. The custom
code processes the data for each user:

- The country code is taken from the first 2 characters in the bc
attribute.

    This shows how you can use custom directory attributes to provide
values for standard fields being sent to Adobe.

- The user is added to groups that come from subco attribute and
the bc attribute (in addition to any mapped groups from the group
map in the configuration file).

    This shows how to customize the group or product configuration
list to get users synced into additional groups.

If the hook code references Adobe groups or product
configurations that do not already appear in the **groups**
section of the main configuration file, they are listed under
**extended_adobe_groups**. This list effectively extends the
set of Adobe groups that are considered . See
[Advanced Group and Product Management](#advanced-group-and-product-management)
for more information.

## Hook code variables

The code in the `after_mapping_hook` is isolated from the rest of
the User Sync program except for the following variables.

### Input values

The following variables can be read in the custom code.  They
should not be written, and writes tot them have no effect; they
exist to express the source directory data about the user.

* `source_attributes`: A per-user dictionary of user attributes
  retrieved from the directory system. As a Python dictionary,
  technically, this value is mutable, but changing it from custom
  code has no effect.

* `source_groups`: A frozen set of directory groups found for a
specific user while traversing configured directory groups.

### Input/output values

The following variables can be read and written by the custom
code. They come in carrying data set by the default attribute and
group mapping operations on the current directory user, and can
be written so as to change the actions performed on the
corresponding Adobe user.

* `target_attributes`: A per-user Python dictionary whose keys
are the Adobe-side attributes that are to be set. Changing a
value in this dictionary will change the value written on the
Adobe side. Because Adobe pre-defines a fixed set of attributes,
adding a key to this dictionary has no effect.  The keys in this
dictionary are:
    * `firstName` - ignored for AdobeID, used elsewhere
    * `lastName` - ignored for AdobeID, used elsewhere
    * `email` - used everywhere
    * `country` - ignored for AdobeID, used elsewhere
    * `username` - ignored for all but Federated ID
      [configured with username-based login](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/help/configure-sso.html)
    * `domain` - ignored for all but Federated ID [configured with username-based login](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/help/configure-sso.html)
* `target_groups`: A per-user Python set that collects the
Adobe-side user groups and product configurations to which the
user is added when `process-groups` is specified for the sync
run.  Each value is a set of names. The set is initialized by
applying the group mappings in the main configurations file, and
changes made to this set (additions or removals) will change the
set of groups that are applied to the user on the Adobe side.
* `hook_storage`: A per-user Python dictionary that is empty the
first time it is passed to custom code, and persists across
calls.  Custom code can store any private data in this
dictionary. If you use external script files, this is a suitable
place to store the code objects created by compiling these files.
* `logger`: An object of type `logging.logger` which outputs to
the console and/or file log (as per the logging configuration).

# Advanced Group and Product Management

The **group** section of the main configuration file defines a
mapping of directory groups to Adobe user groups and product
configurations.

- On the enterprise directory side, User Sync selects a set of
users from your enterprise directory, based on the LDAP query,
the `users` command line parameter, and the user filter, and
examines these users to see if they are in any of the mapped
directory groups. If they are, User Sync uses the group map to
determine which Adobe groups those users should be added to.
- On the Adobe side, User Sync examines the membership of mapped
groups and product configurations. If any user in those groups is
_not_ in the set of selected directory users, User Sync removes
that user from the group. This is usually the desired behavior
because, for example, if a user is in the Adobe Photoshop product
configuration and they are removed from the enterprise directory,
you would expect them to be removed from the group so that they
are no longer allocated a license.

![Figure 4: Group Mapping Example](media/group-mapping.png)

This workflow can present difficulties if you want to divide the
sync process into multiple runs in order to reduce the number of
directory users queried at once. For example, you could do a run
for users beginning with A-M and another with users N-Z. When you
do this, each run must target different Adobe user groups and
product configurations.  Otherwise, the run for A-M would remove
users from mapped groups who are in the N-Z set.

To configure for this case, use the Admin Console to create user
groups for each user subset (for example, **photoshop_A_M** and
**photoshop_N_Z**), and add each of the user groups separately to
the product configuration (for example, **photoshop_config**). In
your User Sync configuration, you then map only the user groups,
not the product configurations. Each sync job targets one user
group in its group map.  It updates membership in the user group,
which indirectly updates the membership in the product
configuration.

# Removing Group Mappings

There is potential confusion when removing a mapped group. Say a 
directory group `acrobat_users` is mapped to the Adobe group `Acrobat`. 
and you no longer want to map the group to `Acrobat` so you take out 
the entry. The result is that all of the users are left in the 
`Acrobat` group because `Acrobat` is no longer a mapped group so user 
sync leaves it alone. It doesn't result in removing all the users 
from `Acrobat` as you might have expected.

If you also wanted the users removed from the `Acrobat` group, you can
manually remove them using the Admin Console, or you can (at least 
temporarily) leave the entry in the group map in the configuration
file, but change the directory group to a name that you know does
not exist in the directory, such as `no_directory_group`.  The next sync 
run will notice that there are users in the Adobe group who are 
not in the directory group and 
they will all be moved.  Once this has happened, you can remove
the entire mapping from the configuration file.

# Protecting Specific Accounts from User Sync Deletion

If you drive account creation and removal through User Sync, and want to manually create a few accounts, you may need this feature to keep User Sync from deleting the manually created accounts.

In the `adobe_users` section of the main configuration file you can include
the following entries:

```yaml
adobe_users:
  exclude_adobe_groups: 
      - special_users       # Adobe accounts in the named group will not be removed or changed by user sync
  exclude_users:
      - ".*@example.com"    # users whose name matches the pattern will be preserved by user sync 
      - another@example.com # can have more than one pattern
  exclude_identity_types:
      - adobeID             # causes user sync to not remove accounts that are AdobeIds
      - enterpriseID
      - federatedID         # you wouldn’t have all of these since that would exclude everyone  
```

These are optional configuration items.  They identify individual or groups
of accounts and the identified accounts are protected from deletion by 
User Sync.  These accounts may still be added to or removed from user
groups or Product Configurations based on the group map entries and
the `--process-groups` command line option.  

If you want to prevent User Sync from removing these accounts from groups, only place them in groups not under control of User Sync, that is, in groups 
that are not named in the group map in the config file.

- `exclude_adobe_groups`: The values of this configuration item is a list of strings that name Adobe user groups or PCs.  Any users in any of these groups are preserved and never deleted as Adobe-only users.
- `exclude_users`: The values of this configuration item is a list of strings that are patterns that can match Adobe user names.  Any matching users are preserved and never deleted as Adobe-only users.
- `exclude_identity_types`:  The values of this configuration item is a list of strings that can be "adobeID", "enterpriseID", and "federatedID".  This causes any account that is of the listed type(s) to be preserved and never deleted as Adobe-only users.


# Working With Nested Directory Groups in Active Directory

Note: Prior to release 2.2, nested groups were not supported by User Sync.

Starting in release 2.2, User Sync can be configured to recognize all users 
in nested directory groups, and the example configuration files show how to 
do this.  Specifically, in the `connector-ldap.yml` configuration file, set 
the `group_member_filter` as follows:

    group_member_filter_format: "(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={group_dn})"

This finds group members who are either directly in a named group, or indirectly in the group.

You might have a group nesting structure like this:

    All_Divisions
      Blue_Division
             User1@example.com
             User2@example.com
      Green_Division
             User3@example.com
             User4@example.com

You can map All_Divisions to an Adobe user group or product configuration in
the `groups:` section of the main configuration file, and set group_member_filter 
as shown above.  The effect of this is to treat all users contained directly in All_Divisions or in any group contained directly or indirectly in All_Divisions as a member of the All_Divisions directory group.

# Using Push Techniques to Drive User Sync

Starting with User Sync version 2.2 it is possible to drive push notifications directly to
Adobe's user management system without having to read all information from Adobe and
your enterprise directory.  Using push notifications has the advantage of minimizing 
processing time and communication traffic, but the disadvantage of not being self-correcting
for changes made in other ways, or in case of some errors.  More
careful management of changes to be made is also required.

You should consider using a push strategy if:

- You have a very, very large population of Adobe users.
- You are making few adds/changes/deletions relative to the total user population.
- You have a process or tools that can identify users who have been changed (added, 
removed, attribute changes, or group changes) in an automated way.
- You have a process that first removes product entitlements from departing users, and 
then (after a waiting period) fully deletes their accounts.

The push strategy avoids all the overhead of reading large numbers of users from either side, and
you can only do that if you can isolate the specific users that need to be updated (e.g., by
putting them in a special group).

To use push notification, you will need to be able to gather updates to be made 
unconditionally into a separate file or directory group.  User deletions also must 
be segregated from user additions and updates.  Updates and deletions are then run
in separate invocations of the User Sync tool.

Many approaches are possible using push techniques with User Sync.  The next sections
describe one recommended approach.  To make it concrete, let us assume there are two
Adobe products that have been purchased and are to be managed using User Sync: Creative Cloud,
and Acrobat Pro.  To grant access, assume you have created two product configurations named
Creative_Cloud and Acrobat_Pro, and two directory groups named cc_users and acrobat_users.
The map in the User Sync configuration file would look like this:

    groups:
      - directory_group: acrobat_users
        adobe_groups:
          - "Acrobat_Pro"
      - directory_group: cc_users
        adobe_groups:
          - "Creative_Cloud"



## Using a special directory group to drive User Sync push

An additional directory group is created to collect users to be updated.  For example, 
use a directory group `updated_adobe_users` for new or updated users (those whose group membership
has changed).  Removing users from both of the mapped groups revokes any product access
and frees licenses held by users. 

The command-line to use to process the additions and updates is:

    user-sync –t --strategy push --process-groups --users group updated_adobe_users

Notice the `--strategy push` on the command line: that’s what causes User Sync NOT
to try to read the Adobe-side directory first, and to instead just push the updates
to Adobe.

Also notice the `-t` on the command line to run in "test mode".  If the actions appear
to be as you expect, remove the -t to have User Sync actually make the changes.

When `--strategy push` is specified, users are pushed over to Adobe with all of their 
mapped groups *added* and any mapped groups they are not supposed to be in *removed*.  
That way moving a user from one directory group to another, where they have different 
mappings, will cause that user to be switched on the Adobe side at the next push.

This approach will not delete or remove accounts, but will revoke
access to any products and free licenses.  To delete accounts, a different approach is 
needed which is described in the next section.

The process to support this approach consists of the following steps:

- Whenever you add a new user, or change a user’s groups in the directory (including 
removing from all groups, which essentially disables all product entitlements), you also
add that user to the “updated_adobe_users” group.
- Once a day (or at a frequency you choose), you run a sync job with the parameters
shown above.
- This job causes all the updated users to be created if necessary and to have their 
mapped groups updated on the Adobe side.
- Once the job has run, you remove the users from the updated_adobe_users group (because 
their changes have been pushed).

At any time, you can also run a User Sync job in regular (non-push) mode to get the complete
functionality of User Sync.  This will pick up any changes that might have been missed,
correct changes made not using User Sync, and/or perform actual account deletions.  
The command line would be something like:

    user-sync --process-groups --users mapped --adobe-only-user-action remove


## Using a file to drive User Sync push

You can use a file as the input to User Sync.  In this case, the directory itself
is not accessed by User Sync.  You can create the files (one for adds and updates
and one for deletions) manually or using a script that obtains information from
some other source.

Create a file “users-file.csv” with information on users to add or update. An example of
the file is:

    firstname,lastname,email,country,groups,type,username,domain
    Jane 1,Doe,jdoe1+1@example.com,US,acrobat_users
    Jane 2,Doe,jdoe2+2@example.com,US,"cc_users,acrobat_users"

The command line to push updates from the file is:

    user-sync –t --strategy push --process-groups --users file users-file.csv

Run without the `-t` when you are ready for the actions to take effect.

To remove users, a separate file is created with a different format.  Example contents could be:

    type,username,domain
    adobeID,jimbo@gmail.com,
    enterpriseID,jsmith1@ent-domain-example.com,
    federatedID,jsmith2,user-login-fed-domain.com
    federatedID,jsmith3@email-login-fed-domain.com,

Each entry must include the identity type, user email or user name, and, for a federated identity type
that is set for username login, the domain.

The command line to process deletions based on a file like this (say remove-list.csv) is:

    user-sync -t --adobe-only-user-list remove-list.csv --adobe-only-user-action remove

The action "remove" could be "remove-adobe-groups" or "delete" to keep the account in the organization
or to delete it, respectively.  Also note `-t` for test mode.

The process to support this approach consists of the following steps:

- Whenever you add a new user, or change a user’s groups in the directory (including 
removing from all groups, which essentially disables all product entitlements), you also
add an entry to the "users-file.csv" that includes the groups the user should be in.  This might
be more or fewer groups than they are currently in.
- Whenever a user is to be removed, add an entry to the "remove-list.csv" file.
- Once a day (or at a frequency you choose), you run the two sync job with the parameters
shown above (one for adds and updates and one for deletions).
- These jobs causes all the updated users to have their mapped groups updated on the Adobe 
side, and removed users to be removed from the Adobe side.
- Once the job has run, clear out the files (because their changes have been pushed) to prepare for
the next batch.

# Additional Group Options

It is possible for the User Sync Tool to sync group relationships that
are not explicitly mapped out in `user-sync-config.yml`.  Any LDAP group
that a user belongs to directly can be mapped and targeted to an Adobe
profile or user group using the `additional_groups` configuration
option.

* Additional groups are identified with a regular expression
* The name of the mapped Adobe group can be customized with a regular
expression substitution string.

Possible use cases:

* Metadata such as department, employee type, etc
* ACL groups for [Adobe Experience Manager](https://www.adobe.com/marketing/experience-manager.html)
* Special-case group, role or profile assignment

## Additional Group Rules

`additional_groups` is defined in `user-sync-config.yml` in the `groups`
object.  It specifies a list of rules to identify and filter groups
present in the `memberOf` LDAP attribute, as well as rules that govern
how corresponding Adobe groups should be named.  Groups that are
discovered with this feature will be added to a user's list of
targeted Adobe groups.

**Note:** Additional group mapping will fail if a multiple source groups
map to the same target group.

## Configure 'dynamic_group_member_attribute'

From User Sync tool 2.5 onward, you are required to mention the `memberOf` 
LDAP attribute in `connector-ldap.yml`. There is no default value and if 
`addtional_groups` is defined but `dynamic_group_member_attribute` not defined,
you would see an warning. Here is example:

```yaml
dynamic_group_member_attribute: 'memberOf'
```

## Additional Group Example

Suppose an Adobe Experience Manager customer would like
to sync all AEM users to the admin console.  They define a group
mapping in `user-sync-config.yml` to map the LDAP group `AEM-USERS` to
the Adobe group `Adobe Experience Manager`.

```yaml
    - directory_group: "AEM-USERS"
      adobe_groups:
        - "Adobe Experience Manager"
```

This example company's AEM users fall into two broad categories -
authors and publishers.  These users already belong to LDAP groups that
correspond to each role - `AEM-ACL-AUTHORS` and `AEM-ACL-PUBLISHERS`,
respectively.  Suppose this company wishes to assign users to these
additional groups when syncing users.  Assuming group membership
information can be found in the `memberOf` user attribute, they can
leverage the `additional_groups` config option.

```yaml
directory_users:
  # ... additional directory config options
  groups:
    # ... group mappings, etc
  additional_groups:
    - source: "AEM-ACL-(.+)"
      target: "AEM-(\\1)"
```

`additional_groups` contains a list of additional group rules. `source`
is a regular expression that identifies the group.  Only groups that
match a `source` regex will be included.  `target` is a regex
substitution string that allows group names to be renamed.  In this
case, any group beginning with `AEM-ACL` will be renamed to `AEM-[role]`.
Each rule is executed on the list of groups a user directly belongs to.
In this example, authors and publishers are added to their respective
Adobe user group (`AEM-AUTHORS` or `AEM-PUBLISHERS`).

Note: The company in this example can also add mappings for authors
and publishers to the group mapping in `user-sync-config.yml`.  The
advantage to using the additional groups mechanism is that it
will apply dynamically to any LDAP group that matches the regex
`AEM-ACL-(.+)`.  If additional AEM roles are introduced, they will
be included in sync as long as they follow that naming convention -
no configuration change would be needed.

## Targeting Secondary Orgs

Secondary organizations can be targeted using the additional group
rules.  Just add the prefix `[org_name]::` to the target group
pattern.

```yaml
  additional_groups:
    - source: "ACL-GRP-(\\d+)"
      target: "org2::ACL Group \\1"
```

# Automatic Group Creation

The User Sync Tool can be configured to automatically create targeted
Adobe user groups that do not already exist.  This can be used in
conjunction with the additional groups functionality detailed in the
previous section, but it also applies to Adobe groups targeted in
the group mapping as well as the extension config.

`group_sync_options` is defined in the `directory_users` section in
`user-sync-config.yml`.  It contains an object that currently has just
one key - `auto_create`. `auto_create` is boolean and is `False` by
default.

To enable dynamic group creation, set `auto_create` to `True`:

```yaml
directory_users:
  # ... additional directory config options
  group_sync_options:
    auto_create: True
```

With auto create enabled, a given Adobe group will be created if the
following conditions are true:

1. Group is targeted for at least one user
2. Group does not currently exist
3. The `--process-groups` command argument is set (or the equivalent
   invocation option)

New groups are always created as user groups.  The UMAPI does not
support product profile creation, so the Sync Tool can't create them.
If the Sync Tool is configured to target a misspelled profile name, or
a profile that doesn't exist, it will automatically create a user group
with the specified name.

## Targeting Secondary Orgs

Groups targeted to secondary organizations will be automatically
created on those organizations if `auto_create` is enabled.

# Two-Step Lookup

Some LDAP systems may not support a `memberOf` overlay the way other systems like Active Directory do. This can make it
impossible for the LDAP connector to use its group-based queries to get members for particular groups in an LDAP system.

The `two_steps_lookup` option in `connector-ldap.yml` can be used to overcome this limitation. With two-step lookup
enabled and configured, the sync tool will retrieve group membership from the specified `group_member_attribute_name`
attribute. User metadata from these queries is then verified to be part of the `base_dn` and the full user record is retrieved.

Example:

```yaml
two_steps_lookup:
  group_member_attribute_name: "member"
  nested_group: False
```

`group_member_attribute_name` defines the user attribute to use for group membership information. `nested_group` will
recursively query nested group memberships.

**NOTE:** `group_member_filter_format` may not be defined when two-step lookup is enabled.

# Enterprise Storage Model (ESM)

Organizations with Enterprise Storage Model (ESM) enabled handle users differently from traditional User Storage Model (USM) organizations. ESM organizations use Business IDs instead of Adobe IDs. Business IDs are special accounts that govern a user's profile for a specific organization. Business IDs do not directly provide authentication capabilities for users. Instead, each is linked to an Adobe ID, Enterprise ID or Federated ID that handles authentication.

The User Management API exposes a user's underlying authenticating account type. For example, if a Business ID user has an email address with a domain claimed to a federated directory, then when queried from the UMAPI will have the type `federatedID`.

This means that sync to an ESM target should use the underlying type. Just set the `user_identity_type` as intended in `user-sync-config.yml` (typically `enterpriseID` or `federatedID`).

## User Exclusion Caveat

Unlike USM, an ESM Admin Console does not provide a choice of identity type for new users. If a new user is on a claimed domain, then it is automatically linked to an enterprise or federated ID (a new account is created in the directory if needed).

This means you must take care when configuring user exclusions as there may be admins in the console that will be identified as enterprise or federated in the UMAPI.

The example `user-sync-config.yml` recommends these defaults:

```yaml
adobe_users:
  exclude_identity_types:
    - adobeID
  exclude_adobe_groups:
    - _org_admin
```

This excludes all system admins (using the special `_org_admin` group) and any user linked to a plain `adobeID`. This may not be sufficient to exclude all intended users from sync.

If you have other users you wish to protect (non-system admins for instance), consider excluding them by email address (`exclude_users`) or set up a special group for them in the console UI and add that group to the `exclude_adobe_groups` list.
