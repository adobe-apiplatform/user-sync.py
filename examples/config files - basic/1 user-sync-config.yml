# This is the main configuration file for User Sync from Adobe.
#
# This sample configuration file contains examples of every setting you can specify.
# Every setting is documented as either (required) or (optional) and, when optional,
# the value given is either the default or the recommended value.
#
# It is recommended that you construct your own configuration file by copying
# this sample and then customizing it.  Feel free to remove extraneous commentary
# when you do your customization; doing so can greatly increase legibility.

# The adobe_users section controls connection to the Adobe UM API endpoints
# and also which users on the Adobe side are eligible to be updated.
adobe_users:
  # These three settings control which Adobe users are excluded from
  # being updated by User Sync.  All three default to no value, meaning
  # that (by default) all users on the Adobe side can be updated and/or
  # deleted by User Sync.
  #
  # (optional) exclude_identity_types (no default value)
  # exclude_identity_types is a list of values, each of which must be
  # one of "adobeID", "enterpriseID", or "federatedID".  Any Adobe-side
  # user who has one of these identity types listed in this setting
  # is excluded from updates by User Sync.  [NOTE: It is highly
  # recommended that you exclude any identity types that a specific
  # User Sync job is not meant to manage.  For example, a job that is
  # meant to manage Enterprise ID users should exclude updates to both
  # Federated ID and Adobe ID users, so that they aren't inadvertently
  # removed because your directory doesn't contain them.]
  exclude_identity_types:
    - adobeID
  # (optional) exclude_adobe_groups (no default value)
  # exclude_adobe_groups is a list of values, each of which is a string
  # that names a product configuration or user group on the Adobe side.
  # Any user in one or more of the named Adobe groups is excluded from
  # updates by User Sync.
  exclude_adobe_groups:
    - "Sample Product Configuration"
    - "Sample User Group"
  # (optional) exclude_users (no default value)
  # exclude_users is a list of values, each of which is a Python
  # regular expression.  Users who match any of these regular expressions
  # are excluded from updates by User Sync.
  # NOTE: The specified regular expression must match the complete
  # username (not a substring), and the match is case-insensitive.
  # Except in the case of federated IDs that do username-based login,
  # the username of a user is the same as the email of the user.
  exclude_users:
    - ".*@special.com"
    - "freelancer-[0-9]+.*"

  # (required) connectors
  # The connectors section specifies how to connect User Sync to Adobe.
  connectors:
    # (required) umapi
    # umapi stands for User Management API, and is the protocol
    # used to read and write users on the Adobe side.  The value
    # of the umapi setting is the absolute or relative pathname
    # of a file that contains your UMAPI endpoint and credential
    # information. (See the documentation for details.)  If you
    # use a relative pathname, it is interpreted relative to the
    # location of this configuration file, not relative to the
    # working directory of your User Sync process.
    umapi: "2 connector-umapi.yml"

# The directory_users section controls how customer-side users are accessed,
# sets default values for attributes not specified in the customer directory,
# and also determines how customer-side directory groups correspond to
# Adobe-side product configurations and user groups.
directory_users:
  # (optional) user_identity_type (default value enterpriseID)
  # All Adobe users have an identity type: one of Adobe ID, Enterprise ID,
  # or Federated ID.  When a directory user is created on the Adobe side,
  # you must specify what identity type the Adobe-side user should have.  This
  # identity type then determines whether the account is controlled by the
  # user (Adobe ID) or by the company (Enterprise ID or Federated ID), and
  # whether the sign-in process is handled by Adobe (Adobe ID or Enterprise ID)
  # or by the customer Identity Provider (Federated ID).
  # If your customer directory does not specify the Adobe-side identity type
  # for one (or any) of your users, you can specify a default type here that
  # will be used: one of "adobeID", "enterpriseID", or "federatedID".
  user_identity_type: enterpriseID
  # (optional) default_country_code (no default value)
  # All Adobe users have a country code, which is a two-letter (ISO-3166) country code
  # which represents the home country of the user.
  # If your customer directory doesn't have an appropriate value for each of your users,
  # you can configure a default value here that applies to any user without one.
  # [NOTE: For Enterprise ID users, specifying a country code is not absolutely required
  # when they are created on the Adobe side.  If none is specified, Adobe will ask
  # the user for his home country at the time of first sign-in.  But to avoid mistakes,
  # it is highly recommended that IT assign the value via User Sync.]
  default_country_code: US

  # (required) connectors
  # The connectors section specifies how to connect User Sync to your directory.
  connectors:
    # (optional) ldap (no default value)
    # ldap stand for "lightweight directory access protocol", which is the
    # network protocol used by most in-house directory systems (including
    # Active Directory from Microsoft).  The value of the ldap setting is
    # the absolute or relative pathname of a file that contains credentials
    # and other configuration settings for accessing your ldap-compliant
    # directory system.  (See the documentation for details.) If you
    # use a relative pathname, it is interpreted relative to the
    # location of this configuration file, not relative to the
    # working directory of your User Sync process.
    ldap: "3 connector-ldap.yml"
    # (optional) csv (no default value)
    # csv stands for "comma-separated values", which is the most common form
    # of plain-text spreadsheet format.  The value of the csv setting is
    # the absolute or relative pathname of a file that contains configuration
    # settings for how the columns in a spreadsheet correspond to attributes
    # in a user directory.  (See the documentation for details.)  If you
    # use a relative pathname, it is interpreted relative to the
    # location of this configuration file, not relative to the
    # working directory of your User Sync process.
    csv: "4 connector-csv.yml"

  # (optional) groups (no default value)
  # The groups setting specifies how groups in the customer directory map
  # to product configurations and user groups on the Adobe side (collectively
  # called "Adobe groups").  This section is required only if you use the
  # --process-groups command-line argument.
  groups:
    # the value of this setting is a mapping whose keys are single customer
    # groups and whose values are lists of Adobe groups.  This mapping is
    # specified as a list of entries, each of which has a directory_group
    # setting (whose value is a single directory group) and an adobe_groups
    # setting (whose value is a list of 0 or more product configuration and
    # user groups).  All of the values in the adobe_groups settings must
    # match the name of product configurations and user groups which have
    # already been created on the Adobe side.  (In this example, we pretend
    # that "Acrobat DC Pro" is a product configuration and "Copy Editors"
    # is a user group that the customer has already created.  Possibly
    # the "Copy Editors" user group has been assigned access to appropriate
    # Adobe products, such as InDesign and InCopy.)
    - directory_group: "Finance"
      adobe_groups:
        # the finance group doesn't use any Adobe products
    - directory_group: "Administration"
      adobe_groups:
        - "Acrobat DC Pro"
    - directory_group: "Newsletter"
      adobe_groups:
        - "Copy Editors"
        - "Acrobat DC Pro"

# The limits section provides processing limits which can help ensure that
# User Sync jobs do not exceed expected guardrails in their operation
limits:
  # (required) max_adobe_only_users
  # After initial population of users has been done on the Adobe side,
  # most User Sync jobs are expected to incrementally update and/or remove
  # just a few users at a time; that is, there aren't expected to be a lot
  # of users on the Adobe side that aren't matched by users on the customer
  # side.  If there are a lot of these "Adobe-only" users found, it may indicate
  # a misconfiguration of the User Sync job, or possibly a temporary problem
  # fetching users from the customer directory.  In order to prevent a User Sync
  # job from doing something in these situations that is hard to repair, such as
  # removing or deleting a large number of users or entitlements, you can specify
  # the maximum number of Adobe-only users your User Sync job is expected to find.
  # In any run where the Adobe-only user count exceeds this limit, no updates
  # to the Adobe-only users are performed, so the effect of the job is limited to
  # updating and/or creating Adobe users who match users on the customer side.
  max_adobe_only_users: 200

# The logging section specifies what console or log file output
# should be produced during each run of User Sync.
logging:
  # (optional) log_to_file (default value "False")
  # Whether you want logging done to a file in addition to the standard output.
  # allowed values are "True" (log to both) or "False" (log only to standard output).
  log_to_file: False
  # (optional) file_log_directory (default value "logs")
  # An absolute or relative path to the directory where log files should be placed.
  # A single file is created per day, named with format "YYYY-MM-DD.log", and all
  # logging for runs started on that day (local time) are placed in that file.
  # If a relative path is specified, it is interpreted relative to this configuration
  # file, not relative to the User Sync process working directory.
  file_log_directory: logs
  # (optional) file_log_level (default value "info")
  # This determines the detail level of the information logged to files.
  # Value must be one of "debug", "info", "warning", "error", or "critical",
  # in order of decreasing detail (that is, debug produces the most information,
  # while critical produces the least information, suppressing even reports
  # of non-fatal errors in operations.)
  file_log_level: info
  # (optional) console_log_level (default value "info")
  # This determines the detail level of the information logged to standard output.
  # See the description of file_log_level for details of the allowed values.
  console_log_level: info
