# This is a sample configuration file for the ldap connector type.
#
# ldap (lightweight directory access protocol) is a network protocol used by
# most enterprise directory systems (including Active Directory from Microsoft).
#
# This sample file contains all of the settable options for this protocol.
# There is tremendous variation in the user object structure and attribute
# value structure among LDAP directories even within a single enterprise, so
# you will likely have to adapt the value specified here to match those in
# use in your situation.  All of the settings here can be changed, and
# many do not have default values and so are required.  It is recommended
# that you make a copy of this file and edit that to match your configuration.
# While you are at it, you will likely want to remove a lot of this  commentary,
# in order to enhance the readability of your file.

# connection settings (required)
# You must specify all four of these settings.  Consult with your
# enterprise directory administrators to get suitable values.
# These access credentials are sensitive and must be protected.
username: "LDAP or Credential Manager username goes here"
password: "LDAP password goes here"
host: "LDAP host URL goes here.  e.g. ldap://ldap.example.com"
base_dn: "defines the base DN. e.g. DC=example,DC=com"

#(optional)
credential_manager:
    #This will pull credential from Windows Credential Manager in Control Panel.
    #value: windows_credential_manager
    type: windows_credential_manager
    #service_name is Required for Windows Credential Manger
    service_name: "Internet or Network Address field in Credential Manager"

# (optional) user_identity_type (default is inherited from main configuration)
# user_identity_type specifies a default identity type for when directory users
# are created on the Adobe side (one of adobeID, enterpriseID, federatedID).
# This overrides the exact same setting in the top-level user sync configuration
# file, and if not specified here the value set or default there is used as
# the default value for this connection.  To set an override, uncomment this setting.
#user_identity_type: enterpriseID

# (optional) search_page_size (default value given below)
# search_page_size specifies the result page size requested when
# fetching values from the directory.
search_page_size: 200

# (optional) require_tls_cert (default value given below)
# require_tls_cert forces the ldap connection to use TLS security with cerficate
# validation.  Allowed values are True (require) or False (don't require).
require_tls_cert: False

# (optional) all_users_filter (default value given below)
# all_users_filter specifies the query used to find all users in the directory.
# The default value specified here is appropriate for Active Directory, which has a
# special field that is used to enable and disable users.  The value for OpenLDAP
# directories might be much simpler: "(&(objectClass=person)(objectClass=top))"
all_users_filter: "(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person)(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))"

# (optional) group_filter_format (default value given below)
# group_filter_format specifies the format string used to construct a group query,
# as needed by the --users groups or --users mapped command-line arguments.
# {group} is replaced with the name of the group to find.  The default value here is
# complex, because it's meant to work for both AD-style and OpenLDAP-style directories.
# You will likely want to replace it with a simpler query customized for your directory,
# such as this one for Active Directory: "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn={group}))"
# or this one for OpenLDAP: "(&(|(objectClass=groupOfNames)(objectClass=posixGroup))(cn={group}))"
group_filter_format: "(&(|(objectCategory=group)(objectClass=groupOfNames)(objectClass=posixGroup))(cn={group}))"

# (optional) string_encoding (default value given below)
# string_encoding specifies the Unicode string encoding used by the directory.
# All values retrieved from the directory are converted to Unicode before being
# sent to or compared with values on the Adobe side, to avoid encoding issues.
# The value must be a Python codec name or alias, such as 'latin1' or 'utf-8.
# See https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings for details.
#string_encoding: utf-8

# (optional) user_identity_type_format (no default)
# user_identity_type_format specifies how to construct a user's desired identity
# type on the Adobe side by combining constant strings with attribute values.
# Any names in curly braces are take as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# There is no default value for this setting, because most directories don't contain
# users with different identity types (so setting the default identity type suffices).
# If your directory contains users of different identity types, you should define
# this field to look at the value of an appropriate attribute in your directory.
# For example, if your directory attribute "idType" had one of the values
# adobe, enterprise, or federated in it for each user, you could use:
#user_identity_type_format: "{idType}ID"

# (optional) user_email_format (default value given below)
# user_email_format specifies how to construct a user's email address by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific directory attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value used here is simple, and suitable for OpenLDAP systems.  If you
# are using a non-email-aware AD system, which holds the username separately
# from the domain name, you may want: "{sAMAccountName}@mydomain.com"
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
user_email_format: "{mail}"

# (optional) user_domain_format (no default value)
# user_domain_format is analogous to user_email_format in syntax, but it
# is used to discover the domain for a given user.  If not specified, the
# domain is taken from the domain part of the user's email address.
#user_domain_format: "{domain}"

# (optional) user_username_format (no default value)
# user_username_format specifies how to construct a user's username on the
# Adobe side by combining constant strings with attribute values.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# This setting should only be used when you are using federatedID and your
# federation configuration specifies username-based login.  In all other cases,
# make sure this is not set or returns an empty value, and the user's username
# will be taken from the user's email.
# This example supposes that the department and user_id are concatenated to
# produce a unique username for each user.
#user_username_format: "{department}_{user_id}"

# Some additional info about LDAP connectors:
#
# Unlike the CSV connector, the LDAP connector does not have custom specifications
# for how to construct user first names, last names, or country codes from the
# values of different attributes.  That's because the LDAP protocol specifies
# pre-defined aliases for a large number of typical attribute values, so there
# are already pre-defined attribute names that are used for these fields:
# - the Adobe first name is set from the LDAP "givenName" attribute
# - the Adobe last name is set from the LDAP "sn" (surname) attribute
# - the Adobe country is set from the LDAP "country" attribute
# If you need to override these values on the Adobe side, you can use the
# custom extension mechanism (see the docs) to compute and set field values
# by combining these and any other custom attributes needed.  Seed the
# User Sync documentation for full details.
#
# Finally, some LDAP systems use uids to identify groups, and place users in
# groups via uid rather than name.  The User Sync implementation always reads
# the uid attribute on all objects if the directory provides one, so it is
# able to handle directories which function in this way even though the
# configuration files always specify groups by name.
