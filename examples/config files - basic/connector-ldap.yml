# This is a sample configuration file for the ldap connector type.
#
# ldap (lightweight directory access protocol) is a network protocol used by
# most enterprise directory systems (including Active Directory from Microsoft).
#
# This sample file contains all of the settable options for this protocol.
# There is tremendous variation in the user object structure and attribute
# value structure among LDAP directories even within a single enterprise, so
# you will likely have to adapt the value specified here to match those in
# use in your situation.  All of the settings here can be changed, and
# many do not have default values and so are required.  It is recommended
# that you make a copy of this file and edit that to match your configuration.
# While you are at it, you will likely want to remove a lot of this  commentary,
# in order to enhance the readability of your file.

# connection settings (required)
# You must specify all four of these settings.  Consult with your
# enterprise directory administrators to get suitable values.
# These access credentials are sensitive and must be protected.
username: "LDAP or Credential Manager username goes here"
password: "LDAP password goes here"
host: "ldap://ldap.example.com"
base_dn: "DC=example,DC=com"

# (optional) You can specify what Authentication method to bind LDAP
# connection with. You can choose either Anonymous, Simple, NTLM, or Kerberos.
# If username is not specified above, the LDAP connector will override
# the authentication method and set it to 'anonymous'.
# If you choose anonymous, you don't have to specify username and password above.
# If you choose simple, you must provide a username and password.
# If you choose NTLM, you have to specify the username in this format [Domain]\[Username]
# for example EXAMPLE\JDOE. You can specify NTLM Password Hash or ClearText for a password.
# If you choose Kerberos, you do not need to specify username and password.
# Default authentication method: Simple
# authentication_method: Simple

# (optional) You can store credentials in the operating system credential store
# (Windows Credential Manager, Mac Keychain, Linux Freedesktop Secret Service
# or KWallet - these will be built into the Linux distribution).
# To use this feature, uncomment the following entry and remove the 
# password entry above.
# The actual credential value are placed in the credential store with the
# username as the username field value, and the key name (perhaps called internet 
# or network address) as the value below.
#secure_password_key: ldap_password

# (optional) user_identity_type (default is inherited from main configuration)
# user_identity_type specifies a default identity type for when directory users
# are created on the Adobe side (one of adobeID, enterpriseID, federatedID).
# This overrides the exact same setting in the top-level user sync configuration
# file, and if not specified here the value set or default there is used as
# the default value for this connection.  To set an override, uncomment this setting.
#user_identity_type: enterpriseID

# (optional) search_page_size (default value given below)
# search_page_size specifies the result page size requested when
# fetching values from the directory.
search_page_size: 1000

# (optional) require_tls_cert (default value given below)
# require_tls_cert forces the ldap connection to use TLS security with cerficate
# validation.  Allowed values are True (require) or False (don't require).
require_tls_cert: False

# (optional) all_users_filter (default value given below)
# Use this filter to control exactly which LDAP resources are considered for synchronization.
# If a user is not accepted by this filter he will never be seen by the User Sync tool, even if
# your command line specifies --users all or he is in a group you have specified in your
# command line (--users group g1) or in your configuration file (for group mapping).
# The default value specified here is appropriate for Active Directory, which has a
# special field that is used to enable and disable users.  The value for OpenLDAP
# directories might be much simpler: "(&(objectClass=person)(objectClass=top))"
all_users_filter: "(&(objectClass=user)(objectCategory=person)(!(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)))"

# (optional) group_filter_format (default value given below)
# group_filter_format specifies the format string used to get the distinguished
# name of a group given its common name (as specified in the directory to Adobe
# group mapping, or in the --users group "name1,name2" command-line argument).
# {group} is replaced with the name of the group to find.  The default value here is
# complex, because it's meant to work for both AD-style and OpenLDAP-style directories.
# You will likely want to replace it with a simpler query customized for your directory,
# such as this one for Active Directory: "(&(objectCategory=group)(cn={group}))"
# or this one for OpenLDAP: "(&(|(objectClass=groupOfNames)(objectClass=posixGroup))(cn={group}))"
group_filter_format: "(&(|(objectCategory=group)(objectClass=groupOfNames)(objectClass=posixGroup))(cn={group}))"

# (optional) group_member_filter_format (default value given below)
# group_member_filter_format specifies the query used to find all members of a group,
# where the string {group_dn} is replaced with the group distinguished name.
# The default value just finds users who are immediate members of the group,
# not those who are "indirectly" members by virtue of membership in a group
# that is contained in the group.  If you want indirect containment, then
# use this value instead of the default:
# group_member_filter_format: "(memberOf:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={group_dn})"
group_member_filter_format: "(memberOf={group_dn})"

# (optional) configure dynamic_group_member_attribute with dynamic group mappings 
# From User Sync tool 2.5.0 onward, if additional_groups defined in user-sync-config.yml 
# then dynamic_group_member_attribute is required. Here you specify the LDAP attribute 
# used to filter groups mentioned in dynamic group mappings.
#dynamic_group_member_attribute: "memberOf"

# (optional) two_steps_lookup (no default)
#two_steps_lookup:
  # (required) group_member_attribute_name (no default)
  # If your LDAP system doesn't support queries using memberOf predicates,
  # you should undefine the group_member_filter_format and instead define
  # the group_member_attribute_name.  The defined value should be the
  # attribute on the group whose multi-values are the distinguished names
  # of the group members.  When group_member_attribute_name is defined,
  # User Sync will look up group members by querying your groups to find
  # the DNs of their members, and then removing any of those members
  # who do not meet the criteria of the all_users_filter.
  #group_member_attribute_name: "member"

  # (optional) nested_group (default value given below)
  # By enabling Nested Group, this will allow User Sync Tool to recurse through group membership
  # by looking up each group membership for group_member_attribute_name within each search object
  # and return all the nested user.
  # Depending on how large your directory group is this may impact LDAP server performance.
  #nested_group: False

# Note that this filter is &-combined with the all_users_filter so that
# only users that would be selected by that filter will be returned as
# members of the given group.

# (optional) string_encoding (default value given below)
# string_encoding specifies the Unicode string encoding used by the directory.
# All values retrieved from the directory are converted to Unicode before being
# sent to or compared with values on the Adobe side, to avoid encoding issues.
# The value must be a Python codec name or alias, such as 'latin1' or 'big5'.
# See https://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html#standard-encodings for details.
#string_encoding: utf8

# (optional) user_identity_type_format (no default)
# user_identity_type_format specifies how to construct a user's desired identity
# type on the Adobe side by combining constant strings with attribute values.
# Any names in curly braces are take as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# There is no default value for this setting, because most directories don't contain
# users with different identity types (so setting the default identity type suffices).
# If your directory contains users of different identity types, you should define
# this field to look at the value of an appropriate attribute in your directory.
# For example, if your directory attribute "idType" had one of the values
# adobe, enterprise, or federated in it for each user, you could use:
#user_identity_type_format: "{idType}ID"

# (optional) user_email_format (default value given below)
# user_email_format specifies how to construct a user's email address by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific directory attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value used here is simple, and suitable for OpenLDAP systems.  If you
# are using a non-email-aware AD system, which holds the username separately
# from the domain name, you may want: "{sAMAccountName}@mydomain.com"
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
user_email_format: "{mail}"

# (optional) user_domain_format (no default value)
# user_domain_format is analogous to user_email_format in syntax, but it
# is used to discover the domain for a given user.  If not specified, the
# domain is taken from the domain part of the user's email address.
#user_domain_format: "{domain}"

# (optional) user_username_format (no default value)
# user_username_format specifies how to construct a user's username on the
# Adobe side by combining constant strings with attribute values.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# This setting should only be used when you are using federatedID and your
# federation configuration specifies username-based login.  In all other cases,
# make sure this is not set or returns an empty value, and the user's username
# will be taken from the user's email.
#user_username_format: "{sAMAccountName}"

# (optional) user_given_name_format (default value given below)
# user_given_name_format specifies how to construct a user's given name by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific directory attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value used here is simple, and suitable for OpenLDAP systems.
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
#user_given_name_format: "{givenName}"

# (optional) user_surname_format (default value given below)
# user_surname_format specifies how to construct a user's surname by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific directory attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value used here is simple, and suitable for OpenLDAP systems.
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
#user_surname_format: "{sn}"

# (optional) user_country_code_format (default value given below)
# user_country_code_format specifies how to construct a user's country code by
# combining constant strings with the values of specific directory attributes.
# Any names in curly braces are taken as attribute names, and everything including
# the braces will be replaced on a per-user basis with the values of the attributes.
# The default value used here is simple, and suitable for OpenLDAP systems.
# NOTE: for this and every format setting, the constant strings must be in
# the encoding specified by the string_encoding setting, above.
#user_country_code_format: "{c}"

# Some additional info about LDAP connectors:
#
# Unlike the CSV connector, the LDAP connector does not have custom specifications
# for how to construct user first names, last names, or country codes from the
# values of different attributes.  That's because the LDAP protocol specifies
# pre-defined aliases for a large number of typical attribute values, so there
# are already pre-defined attribute names that are used for these fields:
# - the Adobe first name is set from the LDAP "givenName" attribute
# - the Adobe last name is set from the LDAP "sn" (surname) attribute
# - the Adobe country is set from the LDAP "c" (country) attribute
# If you need to override these values on the Adobe side, you can use the
# custom extension mechanism (see the docs) to compute and set field values
# by combining these and any other custom attributes needed.  See the
# User Sync documentation for full details.
